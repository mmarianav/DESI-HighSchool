I’m Alma Xochitl Gonzalez Morales , a junior researcher at the University of Guanajuato. I’m now based at León city in the state of Guanajuato. 
It is very close to Guanajuato, one of the most beautiful cities in México. Interestingly León, and Guanuajuato, host many international events annually, 
like a Ballon festival, the Rally, and the Cervantino, just to mention some.

I was recently appointed to be co-chair of the Lyman-alpha working group. I’m starting to help coordinate the Worling Group tasks. I also test and help to 
improve some of the code used in the WG. For example, I’ve been working with the code that will be used to determine the quasar redshifts, using it in simulated
quasars, where we know the truth, so that we can know how well this codes performs. I also help graduate students, mostly from the University of Guanajuato, 
to develop their projects within DESI.

For me the most intriguing aspect of astronomy/cosmology is the nature of dark energy and Dark Matter. Contributing to know more about this two mysterious 
components of our Universe is just astounding. Even though DESI is mostly focused on Dark Energy (as the name says so), the gathered information will also 
be very helpful to understand Dark Matter. Now that I’m closely following the status of the project I realize how much work is involved, and that is truly 
a huge effort from many people. I’m so excited about all the science and knowledge that is being developed every day.

I’m really interested in the popularization of science (Iconmunity and Technovation Girls Guanajuato), for girls mostly, so I dedicate some of my free time
to a community, where we organize and give small workshops, talks, and science shows. I hope some of them in the future will become scientists.
